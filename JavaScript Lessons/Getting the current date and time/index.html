    <p>the webapge includes a local date and time in his particular time zone.But what is the current date and time. We can
        access date and time by <span class="blue">new Date();</span></p>
    <p>Note that JavaScript gets this information from the user's computer. It is only as accurate as the computer's date and
        time settings. For example, if the user just moved from the U.S. West Coast to the U.S. East Coast and hasn't reset
        the time zone on his computer, the computer will still be on Pacific Time. The ate object, too will be on Pacific
        Time.
    </p>
    <p>The Date object may resemble a string but it isn't one. For example, you can't use methods on it like <span class="blue">charAt</span>,
        <span class="blue">indexOf</span>,<span class="blue">slice</span></p>
    <p>The following line number 7 is used to get the day.But when you extract the day of the wee from the object it's represented
        as a number.Days are desisgnated by a number from 0 for sunday through 6 for Saturday</p>
    <h2>Steps by step explanation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an array of days starting with "Sun" and assigns ot to <span class="blue">dayNames</span></li>
        <li>Create a new Date object and assigns it to <span class="blue">now</span></li>
        <li>Extracts the day of the week as a number and assigns it to <span class="blue">day</span></li>
        <li>Uses the day number as an index to spicify the correct array element,i.e. the day name</li>    
    </ol>
