    <p>The following code in line 2 converts the string into integer number and in line 6 it converts the string into fraction
        number</p>
    <p>Suppose your code has done an arithmetic calculation that yielded a big number. Now you want to present the result of
        the calculation to your user. But before you display the number, you want to format it with commas so it's readable.
        In order to do that, you'll have to convert the number to a string. This is how you do it.</p>
