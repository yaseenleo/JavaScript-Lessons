    <p>In the code, the variable <span class="blue">currentAge</span>> is a string because it comes from a user's prompt response.But
        in line 2, when the variable appears in an aritheematic expression the value si automatically (and temporarily) converted
        to a number to make the math work</p>
    <p>Similarly if you ask JavaScript to divide "100" by 2 or multiply "2.5",JavaScript seems to understand that you want the
        string treated as a number, and does the math. You can even ask JavaScript to multiply,divide, or subtract using
        nothing but strings as terms, and JavaScript, interpreting your intentions correctly,does the math.</p>
    <p>In line 5 the two strings are treated as number because they appear in a math exrpession. The variable <span class="blue">notANumber</span>
        in spite of the quotation marks, is assigned the number 100.<br />It probably goes without saying that the string
        you ask JavaScript to do math on has to be a number contained in quotes, like "50", not letter characters.If you
        write.
