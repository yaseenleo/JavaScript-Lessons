<body>
    <p>As you have learned about, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierachy of parents and children. Everything on the web
        page, excluding the document itself, is a child of something else. So now let's talk about how your JavaScript code
        can make use of this hierarchy of parents and children to read or change virtually anything on a web page.</p>
    <p>Let's begin with the methods you've already learned for targeting things on the web page.</p>
    <p>The statement in line 1 targets the elements with the tag name which will target all the paragraph element of a particular
        kind within the document. </p>

    <div id="cal">
        <p>Southern Cal is sunny.</p>
        <p>Northern Cal is rainy.</p>
        <p>Eastern Cal is desert.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ny">
        <p>Urban NY is crowded.</p>
        <p>Rural NY is spares.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Here's the breakdown:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Assigns the div with the id "ny" to the variable <span class="blue">div</span></li>
        <li> Makes a collection of all the <span class="blue">&ltp&gt</span>s in the div and assigns the collection to the variable <span class="blue">p</span> </li>
    </ul>
</body>
<script src="app.js" type="text/javaScript"></script>
