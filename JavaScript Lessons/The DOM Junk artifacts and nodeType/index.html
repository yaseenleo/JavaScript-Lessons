<body>
    <div id="humpty">
        <p>All the king horses.</p>
        <p>All the dude's crew.</p>
        <p>All the town's orthopedists.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Here's the breakdown:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Assigns the div to the variable <span class="blue">d</span></li>
        <li>2 Counts the number of paragraphs</li>
        <li>3 Goes through the children of the div looking for the next element node,i.e. Type 1, which we assume is a paragraph</li>
        <li>4-6 Adds 1 to the counter. We're looking for the second paragraph</li>
        <li>7-9 When the counter hits 2, we've reached the target paragraph.Change that second paragraph, it would be a lot easier
            to assign it an id, and go straight to it,like this.<br /> document.<span class="blue">getElementById("p2")</span>.innerHTML
            = "All his men.";</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see why the <span class="blue">getElementId</span> method is more popular with coders than tracing the DOM hierarchy.
        But there are some things you can't do without working your way through the parent-child relationships of the DOM</p>
