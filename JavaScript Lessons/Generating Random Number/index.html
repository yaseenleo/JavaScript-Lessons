    <p>JavaScript generates a random number.(Well, its almost random, technically known as pseudo-random, but it's close enough
        to random for most purposes.The function always delivers a a 16-place decimal that ranges from 0.0000000000000000
        to 0.9999999999999999.</p>
    <h2>What happened in the console line by line</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Generates a 16-place decimal and assigns it to the variable <span class="blue">bigDecimal</span></li>
        <li>Converts the 16-place decimal to a number ranging from 0.0000000000000000 through 5.9999999999999999,then adds 1,
            so the range winds up 1.0000000000000000 through 6.9999999999999999. This number is assigned to the variable
            <span class="blue">improveNum</span></li>
        <li>Roudns the value represented by improvedNum down to the nearest integer that ranges from 1 through 6</li>
    </ol>
