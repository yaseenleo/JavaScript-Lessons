        Rules and Important points of Array removing,inserting and extracting elements
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the <b>shift</b> method to remove an element from the begining of an array.</li>
        <li>To add one or more elements to the beginning of an array, use the <b>unshift</b> method.</li>
        <li>
            Use the <b>splice</b> method to insert one or more elements anywhre in an array.
            while optionally removing one or more elements that come after it.
        </li>
        <li>Use the <b>slice</b> method to copy one or more consecutive elements in any position and put them into a new array.</li>
    </ol> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Since the first index number inside the parentheses specifies the first element to be copied, you might think the second
            index number specifies the last element to be copied. In fact, the second number specifies the index number of
            the element after the last element to be copied.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must assign the sliced elements to an array. It could, of course, be the same array from which you're doing the slicing.
            In that case, you'd be reducing the original array to only the copied elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
