    <p>Suppose you want to give your users the option of doubling the size of the text in all the paragraphs of the document.
        To accomplish this, you could give each paragraph an id. When the user clicks the <b>Double Text Size</b> button,
        a function would cycle through all the paragraph ids and make the change. The function could upsize the font either
        by assigning a new class to each paragraph, with the class specifying a larger font size, or it could assign the
        new style property directly, An easier way to accomplish the same thing is to have the function say, "Find all the
        paragraphs in the document and increase their size by <span class="blue">getElementByTagName("id")</span></p>
    <p>This bed is too small.</p>
    <p onclick="changeText();">This bed is too big.</p>
    <p>This bed is just right.</p>
</body>
