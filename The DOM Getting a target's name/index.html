    <p>It's possible to confuse the node value of a text node with the <span class="blue">innerHTML</span> property. There are
        two differences</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="blue">innerHTML</span> is a property of the element node, &lth2&gt, for example. The node value is a
            property of the text node itself, not the parent element.</li>
        <li><span class="blue">innerHTML</span> includes all the descendants of the element, including any inner element nodes
            like <em> as well as text nodes. The node value includes only the characters that comprise the single text node. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since there are situations in which <span class="blue">nodeName</span> gets you, for example, a "p" instead of a "P" or an "href" instead of an "HREF," it's good practice to standardize the case when you're testing for names, like this</p>
    <p>If the node name was originally upper-case, the code changes it to lower-case. If it was lower-case to begin with, no harm done.<br />If you're checking a node name to see if a node is a text node, converting to lower-case isn't necessary, because the name of a text node is always "#text", never "#TEXT".
