    <p>Let's start with the estimated date. According to the system's trustees, the money will run out in 2035. They didn't
        pin down an exact date. Let's pick the middle of the year - June 30</p>
    <p>First create a date object for the current date and time. Notice how the date is specified it's in quotes. The month
        is spelled out there's a comma after the day of the month. The year is exrpessed in four digits.</p>
    <p>Next you extract both dates the milliseconds that have elapsed since the current date</p>
    <p>Some simple math converts the milliseconds to days. The huge number created by the math inside the parenthesis converts
        the milliseconds into seconds(1000), minutes(60),hours(60), and days(24).</p>
    <p>As we know that the following statement <span class="blue">float</span> rounds the number of day, which is probably a
        floating-point number, down to an integer.</p>
    <h3>Explanation from line 14</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Substracts the milliseconds since the reference date of the current moment from the milliseconds since the reference
            date of June 30, 2035</li>
        <li>Converts the milliseconds to days and rounds down</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the time is important, you can specify that as well.</p>
    <p>Note the form used to specify the time: No comma after the date. 24-hour time. Colons separating hours, minutes, and
        seconds.</p>
