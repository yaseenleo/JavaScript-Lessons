    <p>A funtion is a blockof code that does something robotically, whenever you invoke its name. For example, when you write
        <span class="blue">greetUser();</span> a function with that name executes and a function is called that displays
        an lert saying "Hello there"</p>
    one of the really useful things about function is that those parentheses in the calling code don't have to be empty. If you
    put some data inside the parentheses, you can pass that data to the function that it'll use when it executes.
    <p>When you code inside the parentheses, now instead of just calling a function you're calling and passing data to it i.e.
        the data you're passing is called <span class="emphasis">argument</span>.<br />The function is now more versatile,
        because the message it displays is no longer hard-wired into it. It'll display any message that you pass to it from
        the calling code, via the argument.</p>
    <p>A variable inside the parentheses in a function statement is known as a parameter. The parameter name is up to you. You
        can give it any name that would be legal for a variable.</p>
