    <ul>
        <li>This is just a variation on things you've already learned,
            <span class="blue">document.getElementById(theElementId).value</span> (for form fields) and
            <span class="blue">document.getElementById(theElementId).innerHTML</span> (for paragraphs, divs, and other HTML
            elements).</li>
        <li>It's <span class="blue">className</span>, in camelCase, not <span class="blue">class</span>.</li>
        <li class="blue">Assigning a class to an element this way replaces any classes that the element has been
assigned in the static markup.</li>
    </ul>
    <p onclick="makeBig();" id="text">by clicking in this text, the text will inlarge its size and change its color.</p>
    <p id="p1" class="mulClass" onclick="againMakeBig();">in this paragraph i have assigned multiple classes which will act</p>
    <p>If you want to add a class to an element, preserving its existing classes, you can do it. For
example, suppose you have a paragraph with a class that styles it in Verdana, size 1 em. When
the user mouses over it, you want to double its size to 2 em. But you don't want to lose the
Verdana styling of its original class. Rather than replace the class that styles it in Verdana, you
want to retain that class and add the class that enlarges the font.</p>
<p>the code that replaces all the existing classes with a new one, this code
has two small differences.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Its <span class="blue">+=</span> instead of just <span class="blue">=</span></li>
    <li>A space before the class nameis required</li>
</ul>
