    <title>Placing Script</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Generally, the best place for scripts, though, is at the end of the body section. This guarantees that CSS styling and
        image display won't get held up while scripts are loading. When you embed blocks of JavaScript in HTML (as opposed
        to having a separate JavaScript file), you must enclose the JavaScript code between <span class="blue">&ltscript&gt</span>        and <span class="blue">&lt/script&gt</span> tags.
    </p>
    <p>For most purposes, coders prefer to have all or most of their JavaScript code in a separate JavaScript file, then have
        the browser load this external file at the same time it's loading the HTML file.</p>
    <p>What makes a JavaScript file a JavaScript file is its file extension: .js. The front end of the file name is up to you,
        as long as it's legal. Any of these would be fine.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>script.js</li>
        <li>core.js</li>
        <li>main-code.js</li>
        <li>main_code.js</li>
        <li>maincode.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can include as many external JavaScript files as you like.</p>
    <p>You can include JavaScript files and also embed other JavaScript code in the HTML.</p>
</body>
<script>
    function sayHi() {
        alert("Hello World");
    }
    sayHi();

</script>
