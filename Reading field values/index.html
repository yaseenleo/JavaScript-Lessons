<body>
    <p>In our required field, the form has a <b>submit</b> button that the user clicks to submit the information that is entered
        in the form</p>
    <p>Now, when the user clicks the <b>submit</b> button, the function <span class="blue">checkAddress</span> executes.note
        that, even though the action is on a click on the <b>submit</b> button, the <b>onSubmit</b> event handler is in the
        <span class="blue">form</span> tag, not in the <span class="blue">submit</span> button tag. That's because the submission
        is an event that applies to the whole form, not the <span class="blue">submit</span> button.</p>
    <p>Here's where things get interesting. When the form is submitted, the function <span class="blue">checkAddress</span>        looks to see if the user has entered anything in the email field. If not the function displays an alert reminding
        the user that the email address is required.</p>
    <h3>This is the sequence you need to memorize in the <b>app.js</b> file.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The keyword <span class="blue">document</span>, followed by...</li>
        <li>a dot, followed by...</li>
        <li>the keyword <span>getElementById</span>, followed by...</li>
        <li>the parameter, in params received from the calling code, <span class="blue">fieldId</span>, followed by...</li>
        <li>another dot, followed by...</li>
        <li>the keyword <span class="blue">value</span></li>
    </ol>
