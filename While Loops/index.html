    <h3>Steps in While loops</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="blue">var i = 0 </span>establishes a counter.</li>
        <li><span class="blue">i &lt= 3</span> says the loop is to keep running as long as <span class="blue">i</span> is less
            or equal to 3.Since <span class="blue">i</span> is assigned 0 initially \, the loop will run 4 times.</li>
        <li><span class="blue">i++</span> increment <span class="blue">i</span> on each iteration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A while loop does the same thing, but it's organized differently. Only the middle term, how long to keep the loop going,
        is inside the parentheses. The counter is defined before the first line of the while block. The counter is updated
        within the code that executes when the loop runs.</p>
    <h4>In other ways a while <b>loop</b> is organized along th esame lines as a <i>for</i> <b>loop</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>parentheses enclose the loop limiter.</li>
        <li>Curly brackets enclose the code that executes.</li>
        <li>The code that executes is indented 2 spaces.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since any <i>for</i> <b>loop</b> can be translated into a <i>while</i> <b>loop</b> and vice versa, you can use whichever
        one you prefer.</p>
