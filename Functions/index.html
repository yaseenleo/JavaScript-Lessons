    <p>A function is a block of JavaScript that robotically does the same thing again and again whenever you invoke its name.
        It saves you repitively coding and makes your code easier to understand.</p>
    <p>To keep it simple we'll settle for 24-hours time rather than converting to a.m and p.m. The code will look like in the
        console</p>
    <p>You can write a function, naming it say, <span class="blue">tellTime</span>. After that,t this is the only code you will
        need in order to make the whole bloc execute.</p>
    <h3>Explanation of code</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On line 1 an opening declaration statement that includes:
            <ul>
                <li>the keyword <span class="blue">function</span></li>
                <li>a name I made up for the function</li>
                <li>parenthesis that identify it as a function</li>
                <li>an opening curly bracket to enclose the code that will execute</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>On line 2 through 5 its the code to get hours and minutes.</li>
        <li>On line 6 a closing curly bracket on its own line to enclose the code that will execute</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Again, note that the calling code-the code taht invokes the function does nothing more tan state the name of the function
        including its parentheses.<br /> You can give a function any name that would be a legal variable name, then add parentheses.
        Function-naming follows the same rules as variable naming because, technically a function is a variable. This will
        make more sense to you when you learn more about function in a subsequent chapter.</p>
