    <p>In a while loop the order of instruction is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Declare a variable to serve as a counter, and assign a value to it.</li>
        <li>Start the loop, specifying how long the loop is to run.</li>
        <li>Execute one or more statements.</li>
        <li>Within the loop, as a final statement, advance the counter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A do...while loop accomplishes almost the same task as a while loop.</p>
    <p>The difference between the two types of loops</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of while, the keyword do leads off the statement.</li>
        <li>The <span class="blue">while</span> clause, including the loop-limiting code inside the parentheses, moves to the
            bottom after the closing curly bracket</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the <span class="blue">while</span> clause ends with a semicolon.</p>
    <p>Functionally, the difference between a <i>while</i> loop and a <i>do...while</i>loop is following in the app.js file</p>
    <p>In line 14 to 18, The code says to keep running an alert as long as the counter is less than 0. But since the counter
        is never less than 0, the code inside the curly brackets never executes.</p>
        <p>Compare this with the <i>do...while</i> loop from line 20 to 25</p>
        <p>The alert will display once, even though the keep-going condition—i less than 0—never
occurs. Since a <i>do...while</i> loop executes the code inside the curly brackets before it gets to the
loop-limiter at the bottom, it always executes that code at least once, no matter what the looplimiter
says.</p>
