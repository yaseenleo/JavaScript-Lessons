    <h2>About nested for loop</h2>
    <p>Starting with "BlueRay," we go through the list of last names, generating...<br /> We move to the next first name, "Upchuck."
        Again, we go through the list of last names, generating...
        <br />And so on, combining each first name with each last name. But look, why not have JavaScript do the repetitive
        work? We'll use nested for statements.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The inner loop runs a complete cycle of iterations on each iteration of the outer loop. If the outer loop counter
            is i and the inner loop counter is j, j will loop through 0, 1, 2, and all the way to the end while i is on 0.
            Then i will increment to 1, and j will loop through all of its values again. The outer loop is the minute hand
            of a clock. The inner loop is the second hand.</li>
        <li>You can have as many levels of nesting as you like.</li>
        <li>A nested loop is indented 2 spaces beyond its outer loop.</li>
    </ul>
