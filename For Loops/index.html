    <p>You know the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"? If you're teaching someone the song, you could give them these instructions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Sing "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer."</li>
        <li>Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall."</li>
        <li>Sing "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer."</li>
        <li>Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall."</li>
        <li>Sing "97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer."</li>
        <li>Sing "Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall."</li>
    </ol>
    <p>...and so on, for 192 more lines of instructions.</p>
    <p>But that isn't how you'd give the instructions, is it? You'd be more concise. You'd say something like this:</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">Sing "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the
        wall." Repeat this, subtracting 1 each time, until there are no more bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
    <p>In coding, you run into the bottles-of-beer situation quite often. For example, suppose you've offered to check if the
        user's city is one of the 5 cleanest in the U.S. The user has entered her city, and you've assigned her city to the
        variable <span style="color:skyblue"><b>cityToCheck</b></span> .</p>
    <p>You've already assigned the list of the 5 cleanest cities to the array <span style="color:skyblue"><b>cleanestCities.</b></span></p>
    <h4>var cleanestCities = ["Cheyenne", "Santa Fe", "Tucson", "Great Falls", "Honolulu"];</h4>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">Now you go through the array to see if there's a match with the user's city. If there is, you display an alert telling
        the user her city is one of the cleanest. If there's no match, you display an alert telling the user her city isn't
        on the list.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[0]) {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[1]) {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[2]) {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[3]) {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>else if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[4]) {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>else {</li>
        <li style="text-indent:15px">alert("It's not on the list");</li>
        <li>}</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Conveniently, JavaScript provides a more concise coding approach. Here's a for loop that accomplishes most of what the
        verbose code in the example above accomplishes.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>for (var i = 0; i
            <=4 ; i++) {</li>
                <li style="text-indent:15px">if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) {</li>
                <li style="text-indent:30px">alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");</li>
                <li style="text-indent:15px">}</li>
                <li>}</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="margin:0px">Let me break down the first line for you.</p>
    <p style="margin:0px">The first line begins with the keyword <span style="color:skyblue"><b>for</b></span>.</p>
    <p style="margin:0px">The three specifications that define the loop are inside the parentheses.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A variable that counts iterations and also serves as the changing array index is declared and set to a starting value,
            in this case 0.</li>
        <li>The limit on the loop is defined. In this case, the loop is to keep running as long as the counter doesn't exceed
            4. Since the counter, in this case, is starting at 0, the loop will run 5 times.</li>
        <li>What happens to the counter at the end of every loop. In this case, the counter is incremented each time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The three specifications inside the parentheses are always in the same order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What to call the counter (usually i) and what number to start it at (typically 0)</li>
        <li>How many loops to run (in this case, the number of elements in the array)</li>
        <li>How to change the counter after each iteration (typically to add 1 each time through)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the example, the counter, <span style="color:skyblue; font-size:23px"><b>i</b></span>, serves two purposes. It
            keeps track of the number of iterations so looping can halt at the right point. And it serves as the index number
            of the array, allowing the code to progress through all the elements of the array as the counter increments with
            each iteration.</li>
        <li>There is nothing sacred about using i as the counter. You can use any legal variable name. But coders usually use
            <span style="color:skyblue; font-size:23px"><b>i</b></span> because it keeps the first line compact, and because
            coders understand that <span style="color:skyblue; font-size:23px"><b>i</b></span> stands for "iteration."</li>
        <li>In the example, the initial count is 0, the index number of the first element of the array. But it could be any number,
            depending on your needs.</li>
        <li>In the example, the counter increments with each iteration. But, depending on your needs,you can decrement it, increase
            it by 2, or change it in some other way each time through.</li>
        <li>In the example, I specify that the loop is to run as long as <span style="color:skyblue; font-size:23px"><b>i</b></span>
            <=4 . Alternatively, I could have specified i < 5. Either way, since the counter starts at 0, the loop runs 5 times.</li>
    </ul>
